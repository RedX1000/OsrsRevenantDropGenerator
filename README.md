# OsrsRevenantDropGenerator
This was the first Python and GUI project I worked on back in May 2019 or so. This is a GUI that gives you the drops you would obtain if you killed X amount of Y revenant. This is an IntelliJ IDEA + Python Plugin project, in case any issues come up with running it.

Originally I wrote a small program in Java to roll a die based on this formula: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DpbCbE_WkAYCD6L.jpg:large
